            <h2 className="text2"> Autonomous Driving </h2>
            <p className="text3">
            One of the most significant applications of AI in motoring is enabling autonomous (self-driving) vehicles. AI plays a crucial role in the decision-making process of these vehicles, allowing them to navigate roads, avoid obstacles, and follow traffic rules.

            Computer Vision and Object Recognition: AI systems use sensors, cameras, and radar to analyze the vehicles surroundings. Computer vision algorithms enable vehicles to recognize objects, such as other cars, pedestrians, traffic signs, and lane markings.
            Path Planning and Navigation: AI helps vehicles make real-time decisions on the road by processing data from sensors and mapping technologies. It allows the car to plan its route, adjust to traffic conditions, and avoid obstacles.
            Adaptive Learning: AI allows autonomous vehicles to improve their performance over time by learning from real-world driving experiences. The more data the system processes, the better it becomes at handling complex driving scenarios.

            <h3 className="text4"> Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) </h3>
            <p className="text5">
            AI powers various driver assistance features aimed at improving vehicle safety and making driving easier and more efficient. These systems use AI algorithms to process data from sensors and cameras to provide real-time assistance to drivers.

            Lane Keeping Assist (LKA): AI monitors lane markings and helps the driver stay within the lane by adjusting the steering if the vehicle starts to drift.
            Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC): AI adjusts the vehicles speed based on the distance from the car ahead, maintaining a safe following distance.
            Collision Avoidance Systems: AI-powered systems can detect potential collisions and take action by warning the driver or automatically applying the brakes to prevent an accident.
            Blind Spot Monitoring: AI helps detect vehicles or objects in the drivers blind spots and issues alerts to avoid accidents.

            <h4 className="text6"> Predictive Maintenance </h4>
            <p className="text7">
            AI helps improve vehicle reliability and reduce repair costs through predictive maintenance, where potential problems are identified before they cause breakdowns.

            Real-Time Data Monitoring: AI systems continuously monitor various vehicle components such as the engine, brakes, and battery to detect signs of wear or malfunction.
            Predictive Analytics: AI analyzes data from sensors to predict when a part is likely to fail. It can alert the driver to schedule maintenance before the issue becomes severe, preventing costly repairs or breakdowns.
            Self-Diagnosis: AI can perform diagnostic checks and suggest solutions based on the detected problems, reducing the need for manual inspections.
