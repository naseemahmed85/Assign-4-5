            AI in Cybersecurity refers to the application of artificial intelligence techniques and technologies to enhance the security of computer systems, networks, and data. Cybersecurity threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated and widespread, and traditional security methods alone are no longer sufficient to combat these evolving risks. AI brings powerful tools like machine learning, predictive analytics, and automation into the cybersecurity landscape, improving detection, prevention, and response capabilities against cyber threats.

            <h2 className="text2"> Threat Detection and Anomaly Detection </h2>
            <p className="text3">
            raditional cybersecurity methods rely heavily on signature-based detection, which can only identify known threats. AI takes this a step further by enabling more proactive and adaptive security measures.

            AI-Powered Threat Detection: AI systems can detect previously unknown malware, viruses, and other malicious activities by analyzing patterns and behaviors rather than relying on pre-existing signatures. Machine learning models are trained to identify suspicious behavior, such as unusual file access or abnormal network traffic.
            Anomaly Detection: AI systems are capable of identifying deviations from normal behavior, which may indicate a potential attack. For example, if an employee logs in from an unusual location or at an unusual time, the AI system can flag this behavior as a possible security risk. These systems can also detect insider threats, which are often more difficult to catch with traditional methods.
            Examples:

            Darktrace: Uses machine learning to analyze network behavior and detect anomalies that may indicate a cyberattack in progress.
            Cylance: Uses AI to predict and identify unknown threats by focusing on patterns and behavior rather than known signatures.

            <h3 className="text4"> Automated Incident Response </h3>
            <p className="text5">
            AI enhances incident response by automating many of the tasks that were previously performed manually. This allows for faster and more efficient responses to potential threats.

            Automated Threat Mitigation: AI systems can take immediate action when a threat is detected, such as isolating compromised systems, blocking malicious IP addresses, or restricting access to sensitive data. This reduces the time it takes to respond to attacks and minimizes the potential damage.
            Response Orchestration: AI can integrate with other security tools to coordinate responses across systems. For example, when an AI-powered tool detects an intrusion, it can automatically trigger responses like updating firewalls, notifying administrators, or initiating backups of critical data.

            <h4 className="text6"> Fraud Detection and Prevention </h4>
            <p className="text7">
            AI is widely used to detect fraudulent activities, particularly in sectors such as finance and e-commerce.

            Real-Time Fraud Detection: AI algorithms can monitor financial transactions, login attempts, and user behaviors in real-time to detect potential fraud. If a transaction appears abnormal based on the users typical behavior, AI systems can flag it for further review or automatically block the transaction.
            Behavioral Biometrics: AI can analyze subtle user behaviors (such as typing speed, mouse movements, and browsing habits) to detect potential fraud or identity theft. If a users behavior deviates from their normal patterns, the system can identify it as suspicious.
